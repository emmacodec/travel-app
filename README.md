In this file, i built a project using React JS and Tailwindcss. I'm having lots of fun working with tailwind CSS inside
of my react project- it is such a time saver. I use the React useState hook to toggle my mobile responsive navbar state
and build a custom image component.

in the index.css did some global styling and some variables as well

one gotcha hold the alt key and click so you can type on multiple lines.
